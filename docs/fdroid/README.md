# F-Droid

PdfCraft for Android is built for F-Droid as a **reproducible build**: F-Droid's build server
builds each tagged release from source and checks it is byte-for-byte the APK on GitHub Releases,
then ships ours (signed with our key), so people can move between F-Droid and GitHub builds without
reinstalling.

`io.github.artcraftandroid.pdfcraft.yml` is the recipe for
[fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata) (`metadata/io.github.artcraftandroid.pdfcraft.yml`).
The store listing (title, descriptions, changelogs, icon, screenshots) is in
`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/` at the repository root; F-Droid reads it from there.

## What makes the build reproducible

- **One Rust release** (`rust-toolchain.toml`), **one cargo-ndk** (4.1.2) and **one NDK**
  (29.0.14206865) everywhere: CI, F-Droid and your machine.
- **No build paths in the Rust library**: the Gradle task that runs cargo-ndk remaps the checkout
  and the Cargo home (`--remap-path-prefix`), and no crate built for Android keeps its source
  folder's path (`env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`), so where it was built leaves no trace.
- **No AGP extras that differ**: no VCS info and no dependency metadata block in the APK
  (F-Droid's checker rejects the latter), and no baseline profile.
- **The text-recognition models are in the repository** (`assets/models/`, CC-BY-SA-4.0, with
  their licence and attribution), so the build downloads nothing but source.
  `apps/pdfcraft-android/fetch-models.sh` fetches them again and checks their SHA-256.
- **One APK, for 64-bit ARM**, with version code (version code × 10) + 2. F-Droid builds it with
  `pdfcraft.unsigned=true` and compares it with ours.

Releases are built by the release workflow on Linux, as F-Droid's are, so Windows line endings in
a local checkout don't matter.

## A release

1. Set `pdfcraft.version` and `pdfcraft.versionCode` in
   `apps/pdfcraft-android/android/gradle.properties` (the build checks they agree: the code is
   `((major·100 + minor)·100 + patch)·100 + (pre-release number, or 99)`, e.g. 0.0.2-beta → 201).
2. Add `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<code>2.txt` (at most 500 characters).
3. Commit, tag `v<version>` and push the tag; the workflow refuses a tag that isn't the version in
   gradle.properties. Publish the draft release it makes.
4. F-Droid's update check finds the tag and adds the build itself (`AutoUpdateMode: Version`).

The release key's certificate SHA-256 (`AllowedAPKSigningKeys`):
`7356d58ae3446b3e6cc457d0b9901700376c787310c9dba14e9c11866588eeb5`.
